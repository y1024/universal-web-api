# Universal Web API

📖 Documentation • [English](./README.md) • [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

**Universal Web API** is a **local API bridge & debugging tool** designed for developers. It converts AI web services (e.g., ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini) logged in your local browser into local standard OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible APIs.

This project is dedicated to helping developers perform **workflow orchestration, client integration testing, and personal office automation locally**, ensuring data privacy and security without exposing API keys to third parties.

> ⚠️ **Compliance & Security Statement**: This tool runs entirely on the user's local system as a bridge helper. It **does not** provide any functionality to bypass authentication (login), crack security defenses (such as captcha solvers), or reverse-engineer encrypted APIs. Users must log into their own valid accounts in the controlled browser. Do not use this tool for high-frequency automated requests or commercial purposes.

## 🌟 Highlights

*   **⚡ Zero-config Standard Compatibility**: Fully compatible with OpenAI standard API (including `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models`) with experimental compatibility support for third-party developer tools (such as `/v1/messages` connectivity testing for Claude Code and `/v1/responses` endpoint for Codex plugins).
*   **🛠️ Local Controlled Browser Drive**: Lightweight automation of Chromium-based browsers (Chrome / Edge, etc.) using DrissionPage. All data stays local for end-to-end privacy.
*   **🛡️ Human-like Interaction**: Built-in keyboard keypress simulations, focus emulation, and mouse path movements to minimize account detection.
*   **📦 Intelligent Tab Pooling**: Multi-tab concurrency with default, domain, fixed-tab, exact-URL, and URL-bound preset routes, plus first-idle, round-robin, and random allocation modes.
*   **📡 Dual-channel Stream Parsing**: Combined CDP network interception and DOM mutation monitoring to stream increments in real-time, regardless of the site's rendering technique.
*   **📎 Multimodal & Attachment Self-healing**:
    *   Extract and download text, images, audio, and video content locally from web sessions.
    *   Oversized prompts are automatically staged as local temporary files for upload (for sites that handle file-style inputs better).
*   **🧩 Robust Tool Calling**: Injects schema verification feedback loops into web sessions. If a web model produces invalid arguments, it automatically triggers local correction prompts, boosting tool-calling reliability.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. OS: Windows (Fully supported) / macOS or Linux (Core features supported)
2. Requirements: **Python 3.10+** and a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, or Brave) installed.

### Setup Steps

1. **Download & Extract**: Download the latest release from [Releases](../../releases) and extract it to a path **without non-ASCII (e.g. Chinese) characters**.
2. **Start the Service**:
   * **Windows**: Double-click **`start.bat`**.
   * **macOS / Linux**: Run **`python3 start.py`** in your terminal.
3. **Initialization**: Once dependencies are validated and installed, a controlled browser window will pop up automatically, and the console will open in a normal browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8199`. Keep AI websites in the controlled browser, and use your normal browser for the dashboard and tutorial.
4. **Log In**: In the controlled browser, log in to your own AI web accounts (e.g., chatgpt.com, claude.ai), then keep the target site on a real chat-ready page.
5. **Configure Clients**: In any client, set the API configurations:
   * **Base URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8199/v1`
   * **API Key**: If auth token verification is disabled, use any value (e.g., `sk-local`). If enabled, use your custom configured token.
